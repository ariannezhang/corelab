<p>A pattern language has the structure of a network. This is explained fully in The Timeless Way of Building, However, when we use the network of a language, we always use it as a sequence, going through the patterns, moving always from the larger patterns to the smaller, always from the ones which create structures, to the ones which then embellish those structures, and then to those which embellish the embellishments. ... 
<br><br>
Since the language is in truth a network, there is no one sequence which perfectly captures it. But the se quence which follows, captures the broad sweep of the full network; in doing so, it follows a line, dips down, dips up again, and follows an irregular course, a little like a needle following a tapestry. 
<br><br>
The sequence of patterns is both a summary of the language, and at the same time, an index to the patterns. If you read through the sentences which connect the groups of patterns to one another, you will get an over view of the whole language. And once you get this over view, you will then be able to find the patterns which are relevant to your own project. 
<br><br>
And finally, as we shall explain in the next section, this sequence of patterns is also the "base map," from which you can make a language for your own project, by choosing the patterns which are most useful to you, and leaving them more or less in the order that you find them printed here. 
<br><br>
We begin with that part of the language which defines a town or community. These paiterns can never be "de signed" or "built" in one fell swoop--but patient piece meal growth, designed in such a way that every indi vidual act is always helping to create or generate these larger global patterns, will, slowly and surely, over the years, make a community that has these global patterns in it.

<i>This completes the global patterns which define a town or a community. We now start that part of the language which gives shape to groups of buildings, and individual buildings, on the land, in three dimensions. These are the patterns which can be "designed" or "built”—the patterns which define the individual build ings and the space between buildings; where we are deal ing for the first time with patterns that are under the control of individuals or small groups of individuals, who are able to build the patterns all at once. </i>
<br><br>
<h3>The first group of patterns helps to lay out the overall arrangement of a group of buildings: the height and number of these buildings, the entrances to the site, main parking areas, and lines of movement through the com plex; </h3><br><br>

<i>At this stage, you have a complete design for an in dividual building. If you have followed the patterns given, you have a scheme of spaces, either marked on the ground, with stakes, or on a piece of paper, accurate to the nearest foot or so. You know the heighi of rooms, the rough size and position of windows and doors, and you know roughly how the roofs of the building, and the gardens are laid out. <br><br>
The next, and last part of the language, tells how to 
make a buildable building directly from this rough scheme of spaces, and tells you how to build it, in detail. </i>
