<p> My name is Arianne Zhang. <br>
	I am a Communication Design Major at Parsons. <br>
	I am from Atlanta, Georgia. I'm 19 years old. <br>
	I have a background in fine arts since I started to learn how to draw and paint in elementary school. Design was foreign to me until senior year of high school when I started to make art with concepts and deeper meanings behind it instead of just drawing from life. I think of myself as a jack of all trades, master of none since I am interested in and learning skills in many different areas such as art direction, photography, coding, graphic design, and tattooing. <br>
	When I am not at school or working, I am usually sleeping or watching things on my computer. <br>
